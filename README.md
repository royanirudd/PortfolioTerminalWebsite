# Anirudh Roy Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This site showcases my work and skills in both a CLI (Command Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) format.

This portfolio website offers two distinct experiences:

1. **CLI Version**: A terminal-like interface that simulates a command-line environment.
2. **GUI Version**: A traditional graphical website interface.

Both versions present information about my projects, skills, and professional background.
